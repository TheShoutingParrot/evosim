# evosim

Evosim is a small evolution simulator.

Evosim uses the SDL2 library for graphics. The program can be compiled by simply running `make` in the evosim directory.

## Using evosim

The simulation starts out with a few organisms that breed and by left-clicking on an organism you kill it. You may also split the simulation into two parts in two by pressing 2.
